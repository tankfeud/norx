*** Squeak 4.5 "Theodor" Release Notes ***Language ImprovementsEnvironments- Environments allows multiple classes with the same name to exist in the same image, with code referencing through Class>>#environment.Collections- New and improved sorting utilities for Arrays and OrderedCollections.- New FloatCollection inherits the convenient add:/remove: API of OrderedCollection, but using an internal FloatArray for better efficiency.- An all-new LRUCache implementation.- Promise is now a fully chainable object with decent error handling.Compiler- Moved classifying and logging behavior out of Compiler (a responsibility of Behavior).Numerics- Faster and better Random.- Fixes #log and #ln for integers.Dates and Times- New methods #utcMicrosecondClock and #localMicrosecondClock provide access to primitive 240 and 241, which can provide microsecond resolution timestamps on Cog VMs.- New convenience methods allow creating DateAndTime relative to now (e.g., "DateAndTime now - 5 minutes").- Parsing improvements.Text, Graphics, Sound- Form>>#pixelValueAt: now makes use of the new primitive in BitBlt plugin, avoiding the overhead of a full BitBlt object.- Elimination of the dual hierarchy of NewParagraph - PaintBoxMorph re-engineering.- ADPCMCodec performance improvement.IDE, Monticello and Trunk process improvements- Several MVC fixes allow debugging in MVC once again.- Smart Splitters causes the bars between browser panes to automatically optimize their position.- Fixed color-selection from anywhere on the screen working again.- Improved command-line interface via SmalltalkImage>>#run:.- squeakDebug.log report length is now settable.- MCReorganizationPreloader now resolves moves between arbitrary packages, independent of their order in the configuration.- Monticello's .mcz files, including its snapshot and source.st, are now encoded in UTF8 instead of Latin-1.- New pre-selection highlight feature for lists.- System space analysis now available in Help | About.- Message-traces can be paired more easily.Configuration- Lots of improvements in the continuous integration (CI) build/test. (http://ci.squeak.org)- Installer now documents externally-loadable packages as simple literal structures that can be merged via Installer>>#merge:.- Monticello's ancestry strings can now be stubbed for a smaller image and sustainable Monticello history.History and Accounting Tools- A great new historical website by Bob Arning.- Monticello history and Monticello origin is now available for methods and class-definitions from browser menus.- A new amazing ObjectHistory makes it possible to efficiently track the born-on date of any object to a resolution of one minute. Does only affect new objects.- Added "search history" to Package history browser.Fixes and clean-ups- Packages organized toward eliminating circular dependencies, and with proper concern for existing and future UI frameworks.- Updated uses of SmalltalkImage current to Smalltalk (global variable)- Moving away from use of Utilities.- More preferences made pragma-based.- Compiler factorings and clean-ups.- Diminished excessive usage of ReadWriteStream.- ProtoObject API balanced and minimal.Compatibility Notes- Default Float printing is now true to its internal representation.  Apps must now use appropriate methods to format Floats rather than roundTo:.- ($a to: $b) now returns 'ab', which is a string, rather than #($a $b), which is an array.- Remove OneCharacterSymbols optimization.- LRUCache instance migrations, if any.  See post-scripts in Collections-ul.546, 547.- Rectangles with 0 area (e.g., lines) can now intersect. Try "(10@10 corner: 50@10) intersect: (30@10 corner: 100@10)".- MultiNewParagraph was removed.  Applications should now use NewParagraph.!]style[(42 2 22 1 15 114 19 3 12 19 17 42 15 86 10 64 7 62 9 90 10 19 6 10 4 5 3 16 18 12 20 5 22 183 27 29 24 20 22 30 88 12 4 13 19 10 27 46 41 3 15 15 186 21 4 29 20 25 112 4 22 8 5 9 21 23 151 13 73 20 109 18 89 18 3 28 180 13 102 29 55 19 146 22 4 9 45 9 26 12 71 15 4 11 28 19 77 4 169 19 17 8 139 55 65 12 2)b,,b,,i,,Rcode://Class>>#environment;,,i,,Rcode://OrderedCollection >> #sorted:;,,Rcode://FloatCollection;,,Rcode://FloatArray;,,Rcode://Promise;,,i,,i,,Rcode://Random;,,Rcode://Integer >> #log;,,Rcode://Integer >> #ln;,,i,,Rcode://Time class >> #utcMicrosecondClock;,,Rcode://Time class >> #localMicrosecondClock;,,Rcode://(DateAndTime now - 5 minutes) explore;,,i,Rcode://Form>>#pixelValueAt:;,,Rcode://Form >> #primPixelValueAtX:y:;,,Rcode://NewParagraph;,,Rcode://PaintBoxMorph;,,Rcode://ADPCMCodec;,,b,,Rcode://MVCProject new enter;,,i,,Rcode://SmalltalkImage>>#run:;,,Rcode://ContextPart class >> #maxStackDepthForASingleDebugLogReport;,,Rcode://MCReorganizationPreloader;,,i,,i,,i,,b,,b,,Rhttp://ci.squeak.org;,,Rcode://Installer>>#merge:;,,i,,b,,b,,cred;i,,b,,Rcode://SmalltalkImage class >> #current;,,Rcode://Smalltalk explore;,,Rcode://Utilities;,,Rcode://Model class >> #useColorfulWindows;,,Rcode://ReadWriteStream;,,Rcode://ProtoObject;,,b,,b,,Rcode://Symbol;,,Rcode://LRUCache;,,Rcode://((10@10 corner: 50@10) intersect: (30@10 corner: 100@10)) explore;,,Rcode://NewParagraph;,!
