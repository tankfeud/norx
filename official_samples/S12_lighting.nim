## Adaptation to Nim of the 11th C tutorial, about spawners.

#[
  Debug compilation
  nim c S12_lighting
  (it will use S12_lighting.nim.cfg and liborxd.so loaded at runtime)

  Release compilation
  nim c -d:release --skipProjcfg S12_lighting
  (skip nim project cfg, liborx.so is loaded at runtime)

  Note from gokr:
  The choice of the lib is made in lib.nim
  It will use liborxd for debug build, liborx for release build and liborxp if you use -d:profile

 This tutorial shows how to generate normal maps and use shaders for pixel-based lighting effects.
 It's only one of the many possibilities of lighting you can achieve with shaders.

 The code manage an array of lights, allowing to change their properties such as position or radius.
 The whole object lighting is done in the fragment shader defined in S12_lighting.ini.

 For performance sake, normap maps are computed for each object's texture when the object is loaded.
 This is done by CPU, but could be done on GPU:
  - With viewports that would have textures as render target, instead of the screen.
  - All objects would be rendered separately once with a shader which would only compute the normal maps.
 -> This technique would improve “loading/init” performances but requires more code to be written.

 A more efficient way would be to batch the normal map creation: loading all the texture at once and creating the associated normal maps in one pass.
 We chose to do it on objects creations instead.
 It keeps this tutorial modular and allow new objects to be added in config by users without any additional knowledge on how the textures will be processed at runtime by the code.

 The lighting shader is a very basic one, far from any realistic lighting, and has been kept simple so as to provide a good base for newcomers.
